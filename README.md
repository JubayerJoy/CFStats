# CFStats - An app to show relevant Codeforces statistics


## Description

This app is being developed using Ruby on Rails. This project goal is to build a web page that displays relevant Codeforces statistics, such as problems solved by tag, comparisons between users, problems to do, etc.


## How to install

The first thing to be done is to install some dependencies for Ruby. For this step you must have root privilege. Run the following commands:

``curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -``

``curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -``

``echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/stable main" | \ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list . d/yarn.list``

``sudo apt-get update``

``sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential \ libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 \ libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \ python-software-properties libffi-dev nodejs yarn``

.

Now to install Ruby:


``cd``

``git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv``

``echo ’export PATH ="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"’ >> ~/.bashrc``

``echo ’eval "$(rbenv init -)"’ >> ~/.bashrc``

``exec $SHELL``

``git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build``

``echo ’export PATH ="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"’ >> ~/.bashrc``

``exec $SHELL``



``rbenv install 2.5.0``

``rbenv global 2.5.0``

``ruby -v``

.

Now to install Rails:

``gem install rails -v 5.1.4``

``rbenv rehash``


The last thing to do is to install Postgresql. That's the database this app is being built with. Run:

``sudo apt install postgresql -9.5 libpq-dev``


## Running the app

Once everything is set, clone this repository running:

``git clone https://github.com/pedrobortolli/CFStats.git``

Navigate to the folder generated by the clone and run:

``rails s``

That's it! Now the app server is running locally on your computer! To visit the webpage, go to your navigator and type ``localhost:3000``


## Usage example

Click on "Compare two users!". Now, type 2 valid Codeforces handles and then click on "Compare!". Another page will be loaded containing information about each individual user and also common information between them.
