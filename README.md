# CFStats - An app to show relevant Codeforces statistics


## Description

This app is being developed using Ruby on Rails. This project goal is to build a web page that displays relevant Codeforces statistics, such as problems solved by tag, comparisons between users, problems to do, etc.


## How to install

The first thing to be done is to install some dependencies for Ruby. For this step you must have root privilege. Run the following commands:

``curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -``

``curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -``

``echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/stable main" | \ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list . d/yarn.list``

``sudo apt-get update``

``sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential \ libssl-dev libreadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3 \ libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \ python-software-properties libffi-dev nodejs yarn``

.

Now to install Ruby:


``cd``

``git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv``

``echo ’export PATH ="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"’ >> ~/.bashrc``

``echo ’eval "$(rbenv init -)"’ >> ~/.bashrc``

``exec $SHELL``

``git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build``

``echo ’export PATH ="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"’ >> ~/.bashrc``

``exec $SHELL``



``rbenv install 2.5.0``

``rbenv global 2.5.0``

``ruby -v``

.

Now to install Rails:

``gem install rails -v 5.1.4``

``rbenv rehash``

.

The last thing to do is to install Postgresql. That's the database this app is being built with. Run:

``sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ xenial-pgdg main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list"
  wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -``

``sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install postgresql-common
  sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.5 libpq-dev``


## Running the app

Once everything is set, clone this repository running:

``git clone https://github.com/pedrobortolli/CFStats.git``

Navigate to the folder generated by the clone and install the gems dependencies:

``bundle install``

Then run:

``rails s``

That's it! Now the app server is running locally on your computer! To visit the webpage, go to your navigator and type ``localhost:3000``


## Usage example

Click on "Compare two users!". Now, type 2 valid Codeforces handles and then click on "Compare!". Another page will be loaded containing information about each individual user and also common information between them.

There will be spoiler tags containing links (to the actual Codeforces website) for each problem solved by each user. Also, a graph is ploted containing the amount of problems solved by tag.

More features to come in the next weeks. Some of the current ones may be changed.
